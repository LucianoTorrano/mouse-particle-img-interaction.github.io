Mouse particle colission effect made with HTML5 canvas and JS. You need to transform the image from PNG format to base64 in order to use this animation and work right.<br>
The idea of using this format (base64) its becouse you need to store information from every pixel in a matrix and then animate every pixel depending on the information you have.<br>
